# Advance the world through bounded, consequential situations

**Status:** Accepted — 16 October 2026 (design decision; simulation implementation not yet authorised).

The Road Has Gone Dark will use **bounded, consequence-driven off-screen world simulation**. In-game time may advance persistent, meaningful **World Situations** affecting places, people or groups even when the player is elsewhere. We will not continuously model every NPC routine, settlement economy or world entity, and world changes need not all be directly player-triggered.

## Why this boundary

A static, player-only world would undermine the promised reactive fantasy setting: an unresolved bandit threat ought to be able to worsen, draw a response or otherwise change during a lengthy expedition. Conversely, a broad always-running simulation of hundreds of settlements and thousands of people would introduce high cost, hard-to-test cascading behaviour and unpredictable balance before the core adventure loop is proven. Bounded developments preserve agency and plausible off-screen consequences while keeping the simulation comprehensible, controllable and testable.

## Alternatives rejected

- **Continuous global autonomous simulation:** attractive emergence, but prohibitive design/QA burden and difficult causal coherence for the playable milestone.
- **Predominantly player-triggered changes:** simpler and easier to author, but would leave major threats and people unnaturally frozen when unobserved.

## Consequences and unresolved dependencies

- World Situations and their consequences belong to an individual **Playthrough**, not the immutable **World Template** (see ADR 0001).
- Changes must remain compatible with stable entity identities, saved history and **Player Knowledge**. Off-screen truth is not automatically revealed to the player.
- Simulation must be bounded enough to advance reproducibly across elapsed in-game time and saved/reloaded campaigns; this records an **outcome requirement**, not an engine, queue or event-sourcing implementation.
- **Still to decide:** which World Situations become active or significant, how they are selected or retire, how frequently advancement happens, how competing effects resolve, how the player learns of changes and the appropriate strength/limits of irreversible consequences.
- No new gameplay system or character-programme reprioritisation follows automatically from this design decision.
